Hi Guys,

FYI, attached is a linux command-line application that converts html to PDF, comments follow.

Cheers f

*	Attached is a statically linked linux i386 version 0.9.9 of the program “wkhtml2pdf”. Unpack with:
*	
*	   tar xvjf wkhtmltopdf-0.9.9-static-i386.tar.bz2 


I tried it on a Fedora 12 system, and was able to generate the “test.pdf” attached.  Karen and I also tried 
it successfully on the applab400 running RHEL 6.1. Note that the more recent version wkhtmltopdf 
0.11.0 did *not* work in my hands.  I used a simple invocation with no extra command-line options:

   ./wkhtmltopdf-i386 veriPulse_Portrait/veriPulse4.html test.pdf

1.	Karen noted that the margins need adjustment, this can be done from command-line.

2.	Resolution for rendering (e.g. Agilent logo image) might need adjustment if possible, 
probably just be replacing the logo image with a higher-res one (I couldn’t see a 
command-line argument that would help).

3.	The “trebuchet” font specified in the HTML wasn’t used, a fall-back sans-serif font was 
used instead. It might be possible to install trebuchet font on linux, don’t know hard 
hard it is.
