# ovjTools
Tools and libraries to build [OpenVnmrJ](http://openvnmrj.org).

## Java

### Ubuntu and RHEL/CentOS
The only tested version is the Java SE Development Kit 6u39. If you want to use Java 8, please try building and **testing** on a spectrometer.   

If you've tested and there are no problems with a newer Java, please file an [issue](https://github.com/OpenVnmrJ/ovjTools/issues).

### OS X
The OS X build ignores the java link and uses the system Java. Java 8u92 was found to work.  
Download and install the Java JDK from [Oracle](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)  
See [OSX.md](OSX.md) for more information.

## BUILD REQUIREMENTS

Currently, OpenVnmrJ builds as a 32-bit executable, thus needs several i686 libraries installed.  
*A 64-bit build needs to be tested. All components should be built 64-bit and tested.*  

### Virtual Machine Container

The only requirement to build in a VM is to have the free tools
[VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) and
[Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) installed on your build machine.
This will save you the trouble of installing and configuring an
operating system.  Build instructions for VM containers are
[below](#in-a-virtual-machine).

### EL6 (RHEL/CentOS 6)

The minimum package requirement for EL6 assumes that your system was installed with the
"Software Development Workstation" package selection as required by VnmrJ.  This build
configuration has been tested on CentOS 6.7 but should work for any RHEL or CentOS 6.x.  
```sh
yum install compat-gcc-34-g77 glibc-devel.i686 libstdc++.i686 libX11-devel.i686 libXt-devel.i686 openmotif-devel.i686 scons
```
Optionally, you can also install gsl-devel and libtiff-devel if you wish to compile using the GNU
scientific library.

### Ubuntu Trusty Tahr 14.04 LTS

The minimum package requirement for Ubuntu Trusty Tahr 14.04 LTS assumes that you have
installed the standard desktop edition of Ubuntu.  A minimal install may require additional
packages including but not limited to make, unzip and zip.  This build configuration has been
tested on Ubuntu but should work for any *buntu Trusty Tahr 14.04 LTS distribution.  

```sh
sudo apt-get install fort77 g++ lib32stdc++-4.8-dev libc6-dev-i386 libglu1-mesa-dev libmotif-dev:i386 libx11-dev:i386 libxt-dev:i386 scons
```

Optionally, you can also install libgsl0-dev and libtiff5-dev if you wish to compile 
components using the GNU scientific library.  Code compiled with the GSL will be subject
to license restrictions.  

Full package requirements including dependent packages are listed in the appendix of
this document.  

### OS X

[See OSX.md](OSX.md)

## BUILDING

### In a Virtual Machine

There are several ready-to-use VM descriptions (using
[Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) ) for CentOS 6/7 and Ubuntu
14.04 16.04, and 18.04.  These automatically create and configure the
OS in a VM for building and running OpenVnmrJ.  The Vagrant files and
machines live in the [vms/](vms/) directory.

To build OpenVnmrJ using one of these machine descriptions, after
installing Vagrant and the [vbguest
plugin](https://github.com/dotless-de/vagrant-vbguest), just checkout
this ovjTools repository and then run the VM build script
[build_vm.sh](bin/build_vm.sh):

(in this example CentOS 6)

```sh
git clone git@github.com:OpenVnmrJ/ovjTools.git
export OVJ_TOOLS=`pwd`/ovjTools
${OVJ_TOOLS}/bin/build_vm.sh centos6   # do the actual build, will take ~1 h the first time
...
cd ${OVJ_TOOLS}/vms/centos6
VMGUI=y vagrant reload                 # this will reboot the VM in graphical mode
```

to build for multiple OS targets at the same time, just add the target
name to the command line, currently tested targets are `centos6`,
`centos7`, `ubuntu14`, `ubuntu16`, and `ubuntu18`.

The [build_vm.sh](bin/build_vm.sh) script lets you specify the git
branch and github username.  To build the "development" branch from a
github user "ghuser" on both centos6 and ubuntu14 :

```sh
./bin/build_vm.sh centos6 ubuntu14 --gitname ghuser --branch development 
```

If there are any build errors, you can log into the VM locally through
ssh and inspect the build.log:

```sh
cd ${OVJ_TOOLS}/vms/centos6
vagrant up
vagrant ssh
[now logged into the VM...]
cd $ovjBuildDir/logs/
more build*
```

The actual install of OpenVnmrJ (currently) requires graphical user
interaction with the java gui, so to complete the install of
OpenVnmrJ, you have to boot the VM with the GUI enabled and run the
installer manually:

```sh
cd ${OVJ_TOOLS}/vms/centos6
VMGUI=y vagrant up
[open a terminal in the VM]
cd $ovjBuildDir/dvdimageOVJ_.../
./load.nmr
```

### Ubuntu and CentOS

These instructions work for Ubuntu and CentOS (RHEL).  

Make a directory. Lets call it ovjbuild and change into that directory.
Check out the ovjTools repository from GitHub with  
```
mkdir ovjbuild && cd ovjbuild
git clone https://github.com/OpenVnmrJ/ovjTools.git
export ovjBuildDir=`pwd`
export OVJ_TOOLS=$ovjBuildDir/ovjTools
```
or Download it from the GitHub web site. If you download it, move it to the ovjbuild directory
and unzip it with the commands
```
mv ~/Downloads/ovjTools-master.zip .
unzip ovjTools-master.zip
rm ovjTools-master.zip
```

The ovjTools directory contains the following diretories and files.   
```
bin            Scripts to build the OpenVnmrJ package
fftw           Used by xrecon (imaging program)
fftw_mac       Used by xrecon MacOS version (imaging program)
gsllibs        Used by programs in bin_image
java           Used by all java programs. It is a soft link to the java jdk.
JavaPackages   Used by vjmol and vnmrj
jdk1.6.0_39_64 Java jdk.
JMF-2.1.1e     Used by vnmrj (simplemovie.jar)
junit          Used by apt, probeid, and vjclient
NDDS           Used by nvlocki, nvexpproc, nvinfoproc, nvrecvproc, nvsendproc
pgsql          Postgress / Locator code
tcl            This contains headers and libraries for compiling programs that
               require tcl (Roboproc)
```

We compile VnmrJ java programs with jdk1.6.0_39_64. The java in ovjTools should be a soft link
to the actual java JDK. (On Linux).   

At the same level as the ovjTools directory, do the following  

```
cp -r ovjTools/bin .
cd bin
```

The bin directory contains three scripts. The buildovj script controls the overall build
process. By default, it should work correctly. However, if you wish to customize the build
process, edit this script.  For example, you may decide not to build the Mercury / Inova
version. Or you may decide to move the ovjTools directory to a different location.
The buildovj script is commented to descibe various options.

Other options are described in that file but the defaults should be okay. The buildovj
script collects all the options and the makeovj script does all the work. In general,
the makeovj script does three things. The first is to update or clone OpenVnmrJ from git.
The second part compiles everything (doScons=yes). The third part collects files into the DVD images
(buildOVJ=yes).  

The OpenVnmrJ directory contains the following directories and files.
These files are open-sourced, read the LICENSE file.  

```
SConstruct   This is the definition file used by scons. It is similar to Makefile used by
             the make command.
scripts      This contains tools used by scons.
src          This contains the source code for OpenVnmrJ. Some of these directories also
             contain a SConstruct file that is used to build / compile that specific
             program.
```

Run the command

```
./buildovj
```

This command will compile the entire OVJ package. It will use the OpenVnmrJ/SConstruct file
to  compile the programs in src and place the results in directories at the same level
as the OpenVnmrJ level. The console directory will contain console-specific files.
The vnmr directory will contain files that are generic. The options directory contains
optional software and code that may be optionally installed.  If the buildOVJ and / or
buildOVJMI parameters are set to yes in the buildovj script, additional directories will
be build that are an image of the DVD installer. A log of the build process will be
placed in a logs direcory.  The script whatsin in the bin directory will produce a
summary of the content of the build log file.

In summary, before running the buildovj script, your build directory will have bin
and ovjTools directories and optionally, an OpenVnmrJ directory.  If you have previously
run the buildovj script, there will also be console, logs, options, and vnmr directories.
Depending on your selections in the buildovj script, the default DVD images dvdimageOVJ
and dvdimageOVJMI may also be present.  
When the buildovj script is executed, one of the first things it does is remove any
preexisting console, options, vnmr, and dvd image directories.  

You can also change into specific directories in src and run scons. That will build that
specific program. To compile the java programs, the OVJ_TOOLS env parameter must be set
to point to the ovjTools directory. In a bash shell, the command would be  
```
export OVJ_TOOLS=<path>
```
In a csh, the command would be  
```
setenv OVJ_TOOLS <path>
```

Then, for example,  
```
cd OpenVnmrJ/src/vnmrbg
scons
```
will build only the Vnmrbg program.  


## INSTALLATION


#### For Linux systems:  
Once the buildovj script is complete, and you had selected the buildOVJ and / or buildOVJMI
parameters, you can `cd dvdimageOVJ` or `cd dvdimageOVJMI` and run `./load.nmr` to install a complete
OpenVnmrJ package. If a prior VJ42 install is present (/vnmr is a symbolic link to the VJ42
installation), then the OpenVnmrJ installation will collect various files from the VJ42 install
so that the OpenVnmrJ install should be complete.  See the src/scripts/update_OpenVnmrJ.sh
script. Assuming the VJ42 directory was available, this installed OVJ should be a complete
system capable of data acquisition. After installation, the only thing that should be needed
is "su acqproc" to start the OVJ version of the procs.  

#### For MacOS systems:  
Once the buildovj script is complete, and you had selected the buildOVJ parameter, you 
will have a dvd image that is constructed so that the MacOS utility PackageMaker can be
used to build a MacOS installer. Instructions for building the installer are 
[OpenVnmrJ/src/macos/readme_packagemaker](https://github.com/OpenVnmrJ/OpenVnmrJ/blob/master/src/macos/readme_packagemaker).
If a prior VJ42 install is present (/vnmr is a symbolic link to the VJ42 installation), then the
OpenVnmrJ installation will collect various files from the VJ42 install so that the OpenVnmrJ
install should be complete.  *TODO: A single draggable VnmrJ.app.*  

## CODE ORGANIZATION

#### Directories
The [OpenVnmrJ/src](https://github.com/OpenVnmrJ/OpenVnmrJ/blob/master/src) directory has a
number of subdirectories. In general, each subdirectory corresponds
to one or more programs that need to be compiled. Some of the subdirectories contain code
that is shared by several programs. Some directories also contain a special sconsPostAction
file. These typically are a shell script with symbolic link commands. For example,
[src/common/maclib](https://github.com/OpenVnmrJ/OpenVnmrJ/blob/master/src/common/maclib) has a
sconsPostAction files which creates aliases of
some of the macros.  The SConstuct must explicitly execute the sconsPostAction. See the
[OpenVnmrJ/SConstruct](https://github.com/OpenVnmrJ/OpenVnmrJ/blob/master/OpenVnmrJ/SConstruct)
file for an example.
